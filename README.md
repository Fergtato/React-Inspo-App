# React Design Inspiration App

## [Live Demo](https://inspo-app.herokuapp.com)

For this assignment we were tasked with developing a full web application (front end and back end) using MongoDB, Express, React and Node, commonly referred to a MERN Stack. We were instructed to develop a back end REST API with custom calls for GET,POST,PUT and DELETE using MongoDB as well as a front using the React front end javascript framework and a CSS framework of our choosing.
